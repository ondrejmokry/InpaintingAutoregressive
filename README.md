# InpaintingAutoregressive

This is the accompanying repository for the article *On the Use of Autoregressive Methods for Audio Inpainting* authored by Ondřej Mokrý and Pavel Rajmic, submitted to EUSIPCO 2024.

> The paper presents an evaluation of popular audio inpainting methods based on autoregressive modelling, namely, extrapolation-based and Janssen methods. A novel variant of the Janssen method suitable for gap inpainting is also proposed. The main differences between the particular popular approaches are pointed out, and a mid-scale computational experiment is presented. The results demonstrate the importance of the choice of the AR model estimator and the suitability of the new gap-wise Janssen method.
